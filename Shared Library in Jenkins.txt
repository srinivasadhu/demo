Jenkins Shared Libraries
Jenkins shared library is a great way to reuse the pipeline code. You can create libraries of your CI/CD code which can be referenced in your pipeline script. The extended shared libraries will allow you to write custom groovy code for more flexibility.

Jenkins pipelines
with jenkins u can create pipelines using groovy code
deployment becomes developer friendly
 Beware duplication
some steps(eg-deploy) are very similar across teams: u dont want each team to reinvent the wheel
shared libraries
u can harness jenkins shared libraries and create a set of functionalities that each team can import and use in their pipelines.
example- lets see how we can write a library that each team will use to deploy a given containerised application on a generic orchestrator.
src- directory src has a standard java source directory structure. it is added to the class path when executing your pipelines

vars- directory vars contains script that define global variables accessible from your pipelines
