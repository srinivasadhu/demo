Hi Cedric,

I’m currently working on the KMS Terraform module and want to ensure it fully aligns with NS security expectations before I begin testing and finalization.

Before proceeding, could you please help confirm the exact acceptance criteria for this module? This will ensure the scenarios I implement and test are correct while you’re out.

Specifically, could you confirm:

KMS Key Scope & Ownership

Single-account vs cross-account usage

Which accounts should have admin vs usage permissions

Key Policy Requirements

Any NS-specific policy standards beyond AWS best practices

Required principals, service roles, or deny conditions

Key Rotation & Lifecycle

Rotation enabled by default?

Any constraints on deletion, disablement, or lifecycle controls

Integration Expectations

Mandatory integrations (e.g., S3 encryption, logging buckets)

Services that must be explicitly supported at launch

Naming, Tagging & Aliasing

Required naming conventions

Mandatory tags for compliance or cost tracking

Compliance / Security Controls

Any audit, pen-test, or SEP-related constraints impacting KMS

BYOK or external key requirements (if applicable)

Once I have this clarity, I’ll proceed with testing and share a walkthrough for review and sign-off.

Thanks in advance, and safe travels while you’re out.

Best regards,
Srini
